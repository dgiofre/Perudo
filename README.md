# Perudo

## Rules
### The goal  of perudo is to be the last player with a die or more. 

Perudo is played in rounds. Each player receives a cup and five dice. 
Each round begins by all players rolling their dice around in the cup. 
After shaking the dice, players turn the cups over on a table top, so 
that the dice are rolled and under the cups. Each player may peek in 
his own cup. 

Players bid, guessing at the number of rolls. 
When a player believes that another player has over-estimated, 
they say Dudo, which means I doubt in Spanish.

## Description  
Here we have a simulator written in Mathematica that predicts the comming out probability of the various bets, 
and recommends the best bet by interfering with the data coming out in your hand.
This script also includes the Parker variant that allows the 1 value of the dice to act as a wildcard 
in the dice count for the player who made the call.
